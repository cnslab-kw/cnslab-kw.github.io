The Cloud and Network Security (CNS) lab is a research group in the [School of Software](https://cs.kw.ac.kr:501/main/main.php#) at [Kwangwoon University](https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/), led by [Prof. Jinwoo Kim](./jinwoo). 

Our research interests are centered on (i) finding security problems from real-world networked and cloud systems and (ii) designing novel defense systems for addressing those problems. Specifically, we aim to broadly explore modern cloud computing and network technologies, such as SDN/NFV, programmable data plane, and containers.
